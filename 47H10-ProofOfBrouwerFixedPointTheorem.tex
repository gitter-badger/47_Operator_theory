Proof of the Brouwer fixed point theorem:

Assume that there does exist a map from $f:B^n\to B^n$ with no fixed point.  Then let 
$g(x)$ be the following map:  Start at $f(x)$, draw the ray going through $x$ and then let $g(x)$ be
the first intersection of that line with the sphere.  This map is continuous and well defined only
because $f$ fixes no point. Also, it is not hard to see that it must be the identity on the boundary
sphere.  Thus we have a map $g:B^n\to S^{n-1}$, which is the identity on
$S^{n-1}=\partial B^n$, that is, a retraction. Now, if $i:S^{n-1}\to B^n$ is the inclusion
map, $g\circ i=\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}}$.  Applying the reduced homology functor, we find that
$g_*\circ i_*=\mathrm{id}_{\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})}$, where $_*$ indicates the induced map on homology.

But, it is a well-known fact that $\tilde{H}_{n-1}(B^n)=0$ (since $B^n$ is contractible), and that
$\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})=\mathbb{Z}$.  Thus we have an isomorphism of a non-zero group onto itself
factoring through a trivial group, which is clearly impossible.  Thus we have a contradiction,
and no such map $f$ exists.
