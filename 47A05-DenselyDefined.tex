Given a topological space $X$, we say that a map $f\colon Y\to X$ is \textbf{densely defined} if its domain $Y$ is a dense subset of $X$.

This terminology is commonly used in the \PMlinkescapetext{theory} of linear operators with the following meaning: In a normed space $X$, a linear operator $A\colon\mathscr{D}(A)\subset X\to X$ is said to be \textbf{densely defined} if $\mathscr{D}(A)$ is a dense vector subspace of $X$.
