{\bf Theorem -} Let $(X, \mathfrak{B}, \mu)$ be a probability space and $T:X \longrightarrow X$ a measure-preserving transformation. The following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}
\item - $T$ is ergodic.
\item - If $f$ is a measurable function and $f\circ T =f$ \PMlinkname{a.e.}{AlmostSurely}, then $f$ is constant a.e.
\item - If $f$ is a measurable function and $f\circ T \geq f$ a.e., then $f$ is constant a.e.
\item - If $f \in L^2(X)$ and $f\circ T =f$ a.e., then $f$ is constant a.e..
\item - If $f \in L^p(X)$, with $p \geq 1$, and $f\circ T =f$ a.e., then $f$ is constant a.e.
\end{enumerate}

Let $U_T$ denote the \PMlinkname{operator induced by $T$}{OperatorInducedByAMeasurePreservingMap}, i.e. the operator defined by $U_T f:= f \circ T$. The statements above are statements about $U_T$. The above theorem can be rewritten as follows:

{\bf Theorem -} Let $(X, \mathfrak{B}, \mu)$ be a probability space and $T:X \longrightarrow X$ a measure-preserving transformation. The following statements are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}
\item - $T$ is ergodic.
\item - The only fixed points of $U_T$ are the functions that are constant a.e.
\item - If $f$ a measurable function and $U_T f \geq f$ a.e., then $f$ is constant a.e.
\item - The eigenspace of $U_T$ (seen as an operator in $L^p(X)$, with $p \geq 1$) associated with the eigenvalue $1$, is one-dimensional and consists of functions that are constant a.e.
