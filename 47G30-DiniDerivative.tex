\begin{document}
The {\bf upper Dini derivative} of a continuous function, $f:{\bf R} \mapsto {\bf R}$, denoted by $f'_+$, is defined as
$$
    f'_+(t) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} \sup \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}.
$$
The {\bf lower Dini derivative}, $f'_-$, is defined as
$$
    f'_-(t) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} \inf \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}.
$$

Remark: Sometimes the notation $D^+ f(t)$ is used instead of $f'_+(t)$, and $D^- f(t)$ is used instead of $f'_-(t)$.

Remark: Like conventional derivatives, Dini derivatives do not always exist.

If $f$ is defined on a vector space, then the upper Dini derivative at $t$ in the direction $d$ is denoted
$$
    f'_+ (t,d) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+} \sup \frac{f(t + hd) - f(t)}{h}.
$$

If $f$ is locally Lipschitz then $D^+ f$ is finite.  If $f$ is differentiable at $t$ then the Dini derivative at $t$ is the derivative at $t$.
