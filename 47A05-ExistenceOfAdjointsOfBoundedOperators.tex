Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a Hilbert space and let $T: \mathscr{D}(T)\subset \mathscr{H}\longrightarrow \mathscr{H}$ be a densely defined linear operator.

{\bf Theorem - } If $T$ is \PMlinkname{bounded}{ContinuousLinearMapping} then its adjoint $T^*$ is everywhere defined and is also bounded.

{\bf Proof :} Since $T$ is densely defined and bounded, it extends uniquely to a bounded (everywhere defined) linear operator on $\mathscr{H}$, which we denote by $\widetilde{T}$.

For each $z \in \mathscr{H}$, the function $f: \mathscr{H} \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ defined by 
$f(x)=\langle \widetilde{T}x, z\rangle$ defines a bounded linear functional on $\mathscr{H}$. By the Riesz representation theorem there exists $u \in \mathscr{H}$ such that

\begin{displaymath}
f(x) = \langle x, u \rangle
\end{displaymath}

i.e.

\begin{displaymath}
\langle \widetilde{T}x, z\rangle = \langle x, u \rangle .
\end{displaymath}

Since $\widetilde{T}$ extends $T$, we also have that for every $z \in \mathscr{H}$ there exists $u \in \mathscr{H}$ such that

\begin{displaymath}
\langle Tx, z\rangle = \langle x, u\rangle \;\;\text{for every}\; x \in \mathscr{D}(T) .
\end{displaymath}

We conclude that $T^*$ is everywhere defined. To see that it is bounded one just needs to check that

\begin{displaymath}
\sup_{z\neq 0} \frac{\|T^*z\|}{\|z\|} = \sup_{\substack{z\neq 0 \\ T^*z \neq 0}}\; \frac{|\langle T^*z, T^*z \rangle |}{\|T^*z\| \|z\|} \leq \sup_{\substack{z \neq  0 \\ x \neq 0}}\; \frac{|\langle x, T^*z \rangle |}{\|x\| \|z\|} =
\sup_{\substack{z \neq  0 \\ x \neq 0}}\; \frac{|\langle Tx, z \rangle |}{\|x\| \|z\|} \leq \|T\|
\end{displaymath}

where the last inequality comes from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the fact that $T$ is bounded. $\square$

{\bf Remark -} This theorem shows in particular that bounded linear operators $T : \mathscr{H} \longrightarrow \mathscr{H}$ have bounded adjoints $T^* : \mathscr{H} \longrightarrow \mathscr{H}$.
