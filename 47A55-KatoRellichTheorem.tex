Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space, $A\colon D(A)\subset \mathcal{H}\to
\mathcal{H}$ a self-adjoint operator and $B\colon D(B)\subset\mathcal{H}\to
\mathcal{H}$ a symmetric operator with $D(A)\subset D(B)$.

We say that $B$ is $A$-bounded if there are positive constants
$\alpha,\beta$ such that $$\|Bx\|\leq \alpha\|Ax\|+\beta\|x\|$$ for all
$x\in D(A)$, and we say that $\alpha$ is an \emph{$A$-bound} for $B$.

\begin{theorem*}(Kato-Rellich) If $B$ is \emph{$A$-bounded} with $A$-bound smaller
than $1$, then $A+B$ is self-adjoint on $D(A)$, and essentially
self-adjoint on any core of $A$. Moreover, if $A$ is bounded below, then
so is $A+B$.
\end{theorem*}
